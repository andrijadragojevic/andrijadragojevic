# Hello, I'm Andrija! 👋

I'm a 25-year-old developer from Podgorica, Montenegro. I absolutely love web development—React and Next.js are my favorites! I also enjoy using Python, mostly for scripting and automation. 

I'm always looking to collaborate with anyone who's up for building some cool stuff, so feel free to reach out!

## 🔧 Technologies I Love:
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend/Scripting:** Python (for scripting and automation), wanting to learn Node JS as well
  
## 💡 Fun Fact:
When I’m not coding, I’m probably daydreaming about a world where websites can write themselves... but until that happens, I’m having fun making the web a better place!

## Let's Build Something Cool Together! 🤝
If you're working on a fun project or want to collaborate on something creative, hit me up—I'm always up for exciting new challenges!
