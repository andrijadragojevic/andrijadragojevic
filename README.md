# Hello, I'm Andrija! 👋

I'm a 25-year-old developer from Podgorica, Montenegro 🇲🇪. I absolutely love web development—React and Next.js are my favorites! I also enjoy using Python, mostly for scripting and automation (a bit of machine learning here and there). 

I'm always looking to collaborate with anyone who's up for building some cool stuff, so feel free to [reach out](mailto:andrijadrago55@gmail.com)!

## 🔧 Technologies I Love:
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend/Scripting:** Python (for scripting and automation), wanting to learn Node JS as well
  
## Let's Build Something Cool Together! 🤝
If you're working on a fun project or want to collaborate on something creative, hit me up—I'm always up for exciting new challenges!
